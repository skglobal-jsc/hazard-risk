# Risk Assessment in Arbitrary Polygon Areas

## 1. Introduction

In disaster warning systems or visual assistance systems (e.g., for visually impaired individuals), the assessment and communication of risk information in a visual and accurate manner is extremely important.

Previously, algorithms typically focused on analyzing risk around a point with a fixed radius. However, in practice, many areas that need assessment have irregular shapes such as:

- Administrative boundaries (communes, wards, districts)
- School and hospital areas
- Flood and landslide forecast areas

Therefore, it is necessary to build an algorithm that can **analyze risk in an area of arbitrary shape (polygon)** based on map image data (map tiles) and pixel colors representing risk levels.

Below is a detailed report describing the developed algorithm, including:

- Processing workflow steps
- Position-image-pixel calculation algorithms
- Risk classification by color
- Output statistics calculation

## 2. Overall Algorithm Workflow

The risk analysis algorithm in arbitrary polygon areas is divided into 8 main steps as follows:

1. **Determine polygon and calculate bounding box**
2. **Create point grid** covering the entire bounding box
3. **Filter to keep only points inside the polygon**
4. **Convert each point to tile image and pixel within tile**
5. **Extract RGB color from pixel and map to risk level**
6. **Load base map tiles and remove points on water surfaces**
7. **Calculate statistics of point counts by risk level**
8. **Generate output report for display or reading**

## 3. Creating Point Grid Inside Polygon

The grid creation algorithm works on the principle of evenly dividing the surrounding area (bounding box) into small squares, then checking and keeping only points inside the polygon area.

### How it works:

- Calculate `bounding box` surrounding the polygon
- Divide bounding box into equal squares (e.g., 10 meters)
- Create a point at the center of each square
- Keep only points inside the polygon

## 4. Mapping Points to Tile Images and Extracting Pixel RGB Values

Each point in the grid after filtering (only points inside polygon) will be mapped to the corresponding position in the tile map image.

## 5. Risk Classification from RGB Color

Hazard map data (flooding, landslides...) uses color codes representing risk levels such as:

| RGB Color    | Meaning           | Risk Level |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| 255,0,0      | Red – Very dangerous | Level 3   |
| 255,165,0    | Orange – Warning     | Level 2   |
| 255,255,0    | Yellow – Attention   | Level 1   |
| 0,0,0        | Black – No risk      | Level 0   |

## 6. Removing Points on Water Areas

Some points belong to water areas (rivers, lakes, sea...) and should be removed. Use base map tiles to determine if a point is on water surface or not.

## 7. Calculating Risk Statistics and Generating Output Results

| Level  | Point Count | Percentage (%) |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 0      | 413         | 5.33%          |
| 1      | 141         | 1.82%          |
| 2      | 6489        | 83.75%         |
| 3      | 705         | 9.10%          |
| Water  | 92          | –              |
| Total  | 7840        | –              |

## 8. Conclusion and Future Extensions

The algorithm works accurately with any polygon shape. It can be extended for multiple hazard types, combined tiles, or text reading APIs.
